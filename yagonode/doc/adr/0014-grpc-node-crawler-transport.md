# 14. Carry node↔crawler traffic over gRPC with a node-hosted queue

Date: 2026-07-03

## Status

Accepted; delivery semantics amended by [ADR-0017](0017-crawl-order-lease-delivery.md)

Supersedes [ADR-0007](0007-use-nats-jetstream-for-node-crawler-queue.md)

## Context

The node and the disposable crawl service exchange crawl orders, order settlement and
heartbeats, progress, and ingest batches. ADR-0007 stood a NATS JetStream broker in that seam. In
practice the broker was a third always-on process to run, secure, and reason about on
Pi-class hardware, and it duplicated durability the node already owns: the node has an
embedded transactional store (ADR-0010) that survives restarts. Running a separate durable
log beside a durable node is redundant operational surface.

The seam's committed properties still hold and must be preserved:

- **Fan-in**: many registered crawlers feed one node and share its durable order queue.
- **Explicit settlement**: leased orders remain durable until ACK or NAK;
  sessionless and deliberately deferred work additionally supports expiry requeue.
- **Backpressure**: a saturated node slows the submitting crawler rather than dropping ingest.
- **Independent lifecycles**: crawler processes are replaceable from their durable data directory; queued orders survive a node restart.
- **One swap point**: the node keeps the `CrawlOrderQueue` and ingest-stream ports the inner
  packages consume; only the edge adapter changes.

## Decision

Make the node the server and the crawler the client, speaking one gRPC service,
`CrawlExchange`, defined in the shared contract module and generated into `crawlrpc`.
`StreamOrders` registers a worker and server-streams leased orders; `AckOrder` settles or
requeues one lease; `Heartbeat` renews a worker's leases and carries control directives;
`ReportProgress` updates run tallies; and unary `SubmitIngest` hands one batch to the node
and waits until the node absorbs it. Order and ingest payloads wrap the existing JSON codecs
as opaque `bytes`.

Durability moves into the node. Orders are enqueued in a FIFO backed by the node's store,
keyed by a monotonic sequence, and move into durable worker leases when streamed. An ACK
deletes the order; a NAK clears its worker and assigns a durable five-second retry deadline
instead of making it immediately visible. The lease sweeper returns NAKed and legacy
sessionless work to the FIFO after its deadline. A session-aware unfinished lease remains
parked for its stable worker even after that deadline, so a replacement using the same data
directory can adopt, renew, and replay it without another worker restarting the traversal.
Node startup preserves that ownership and performs ordinary expiry only for requeueable
records. Backpressure is the
unary ingest call itself: temporary pipeline or storage saturation returns
`Unavailable`, which the crawler retries with a jittered exponential delay. Ingest JSON is
bounded below the 4 MiB gRPC message ceiling. The crawler also retries `ResourceExhausted`
from older nodes that used it for application saturation; the current crawler fits the
payload before either retry path can run. Internal control-plane traffic uses insecure
transport credentials on a private network.

## Considered alternatives

Keeping NATS JetStream (ADR-0007) was the status quo. It was rejected because the durability
and backpressure it provides now duplicate the node's own store and the blocking unary call,
at the cost of a third always-on process on Pi-class hardware.

Plain HTTP between the two services was considered as the lightest possible transport. It was
rejected because server-streamed order delivery and typed, code-generated stubs on both sides
come for free with gRPC, whereas HTTP would hand-roll long-polling or chunked streaming and
its own status-code contract.

A node-hosted queue read over HTTP long-poll was considered to avoid a streaming protocol. It
was rejected because it reintroduces the polling latency and bespoke framing gRPC streaming
removes, with no offsetting simplicity once the queue already lives in the node.

## Consequences

The crawler no longer needs a broker address; it dials the node's crawl RPC endpoint
(`YAGO_CRAWLER_NODE_RPC_ADDR`), and the node listens on `YAGO_CRAWL_RPC_ADDR`. gRPC and protobuf
become runtime dependencies of the node, the crawler, and the contract module; NATS is dropped
from all three. ADR-0017 makes order delivery at-least-once through durable leases and worker
heartbeats. Ingest keeps its at-least-once guarantee through the blocking call, durable
observation ordering, and crawler-side retry. The queue seam is unchanged, so pipeline stages,
the ingest consumer, and the crawl-dispatch endpoint are untouched.
